- Four possible roles- Administrator, Receptionist, Cleaning lady and a Guest

<<<< ADMIN >>>>

Has an access to every single entity and can perform all operations on them. In addition, it can add hotel employees and guests to the system.

<<< RECEPTIONIST >>>

Receptionist does all the work related to providing guest services, including confirmation or rejection of reservations that guests can make
through their part of the system, they have an insight into the state of the hotel rooms and when they are free or
booked, they can check-in or check-out guests at the reception, as well as add guests to the system
if they're not already in it.

<<< CLEANING LADY >>>

Cleaning lady has an access to the rooms that have been assigned to her for cleaning up. When the receptionist checks out the guest from the room, that room is  automatically assigned to the maid who had the least cleaned up rooms. Additionally, when the maid cleans up a specific room and enters it into the system, the room becomes available for checking-in. The goal of each maid is that at the end of the day she doesn't have any assigned rooms.


<<< GUEST >>>

Guest is registered by the receptionist based on the email and a passport number. A guest can make a reservation for a specific room type ( while having no insight into individual rooms, but having an insight into which type of room is free for the selected dates).
